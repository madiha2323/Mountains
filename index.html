                    <h1>MOUNTAINEERING</h1>
                    <P>Mountaineering as it is an activity of climbing
                        mountains. It has different types and it requires various techniques.
                        It is a traditional outdoor activity like "climbing" and "skiing".
                        It requires techinical subset of mountain climbing and special trainig and
                        eqipment. Climbing a mountain has been on the bucket list of many people. It is
                        thrilled, risk many people around the world love doing it, somehow it gives them
                        pace and to be honest the more you come to nature the more you feel connected with it.

                        However, mountaineering excites the world. It teaches the importance of unity,
                        you cannot do it without the help of your each group member. It also tells you that
                        <q><strong>you cannot
                                go up while pushing other one down.</strong></q>
                        Climbing one mountain closes you with
                        nature, yourself and with your partner. Each mountain has different story, and it gives
                        you different expirence. Being on top of the world gives you wings, and while on top the world
                        the looks so
                        small, from there you can't even see people. Just imagine how would you feel
                        ? Will you not feel somthing like I said above?
                        Climbing mountain gives you a thrill expirence, Mountaineering differs from other outdoor
                        sports in that nature alone provides the field of action—and just
                        about all of the challenges—for the participant. Climbing mountains
                        embodies the thrills produced by testing one’s courage,
                        resourcefulness, cunning, strength, ability, and stamina to the
                        utmost in a situation of inherent risk. Mountaineering, to a greater
                        degree than other sports, is a group activity, with each member both
                        supporting and supported by the group’s achievement at every stage.
                        For most climbers, the pleasures of mountaineering lie not only in the
                        “conquest” of a peak but also in the physical and spiritual satisfactions
                        brought about through intense personal effort, ever-increasing
                        proficiency, and contact with natural grandeur.

                    <DD>
                        "Alpine climbing" refers to mountain climbing in its most classic form. An alpine climber uses a
                        wide range of techniques to gain a summit, often carrying the bare minimum of technical gear,
                        and relying instead on a deep skill base, adaptability, and good decision making. This tendency
                        to climb in the morning has led to the term "Alpine Start". Many consider alpine style to be the
                        most aesthetically "pure" form of mountaineering." -->
                    </DD>
                    <dt>BENEFITS</dt>
                    <DD>The benefits of alpine style include spending much less time on the route, thereby reducing
                        objective dangers such as avalanches or blizzards. This can be a major factor on routes with ice
                        fields full of blocks of ice hundreds of feet tall which could fall at any time. Snow and icy
                        conditions often change over the course of a day forcing climbing parties to climb in the early
                        hours before the sun melts the snow or ice making it unsuitable and more susceptible to
                        avalanche.</DD>

                    <dt>EXPEDITION STYLE MOUNTAINEERING.</dt>
                    <DD>"Expedition style (or "siege" style) refers to mountaineering which involves setting up a fixed
                        line of stocked camps on the mountain which can be accessed at one's leisure
                        Expedition style also incorporates the use of fixed ropes, and climbers (and the porters they
                        frequently employ) will travel up and down the route several times to fix ropes and set up
                        camps.

                        great mountain ranges can make for lasting memories. At best, an expedition is like a long,
                        exotic vacation—close friends, colourful travel, world-class terrain, and jubilant summit

                    <h1>SHELTERING</h1>
                    <P>Alpine shelters have been perched up in the mountains for generations, providing safe haven for
                        climbers during inclement weather or simply a spot for day hikers to rest and enjoy the views.
                        But the shelters of today are no longer basic structures resembling log cabins or metal sheds.
                        Contemporary architects have defied the challenges of climate and terrain with spectacular
                        designs that enhance the landscape and, thanks to eco-friendly features, help protect their
                        surrounding habitats. We’ve gathered some of the most architecturally daring alpine shelters
                        from Switzerland to Slovenia so you can visit without the trek.
                        A mountain hut is a building located high in the mountains, generally
                        accessible only by foot, intended to provide food and shelter to mountaineers, climbers and hikers. Mountain huts are usually operated by an Alpine Club or some organization dedicated to hiking or mountain recreation. They are known by many names, including alpine hut, mountain shelter, mountain refuge, mountain lodge, and mountain hostel. It may also be called a refuge hut, 
                        although these occur in lowland areas (e.g. lowland forests) too.
                        Mountain huts can providea range of services, starting with shelter and simple sleeping 
                        berths. Some, particularly in remote areas
                        , are not staffed, but others have staff which prepare meals and drinks and can provide other services, including providing lectures and selling clothing and small items. Mountain huts usually allow anybody to access their facilities, although some require reservations.
                        While shelters have long existed in mountains, modern hut systems date back a century and a half. The Swiss Alpine Club has built huts since 1863.[1] In the United States, the Appalachian Mountain Club built its first hut at Madison Spring in New Hampshire in 1889

                <h1>HAZARDS</h1>
                <P>When we refer to hazards in relation to occupational safety and health the most 
                commonly used definition is <em><b>‘A Hazard is a potential source of harm or adverse health
                effect on a person or persons’.</em></b> The terms Hazard and Risk are often used interchangeably
                but this simple example explains the difference between the two. If there was a spill of 
                water in a room then that water would present a slipping hazard to persons passing through it.
                If access to that area was prevented by a physical barrier then the hazard would remain though
                the risk would be minimise.
