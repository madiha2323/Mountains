                    <h1>HISTORY</h1>
                    <p> Commonly associated with the daring ascents of formidable summits, mountaineering
                        (sometimes known as alpinism) combines hiking, rock climbing, and snow and ice techniques.
                        Mountaineers must be properly equipped and skilled in dealing with variable terrain and
                        weather conditions, such as avalanches, moraines, crevasses, and seracs, as well as
                         altitude sickness.They usually make use of ropes, crampons, ice picks, and other technical equipment.
                    </p>
                    <h2>The Earliest Forms of Mountaineering</h2>
                    <p>A few isolated cases of mountaineering occurred in the 1300s and 1400s 
                        for purposes such as religion and meteorology, the most notable being
                        the first ascent of Mont Aiguille in 1492. Charles VIII of France 
                        ordered his chamberlain and military engineer Antoine de Ville to
                        scale the “inaccessible mountain” we now call Mont Aiguille.The team
                        armed themselves with ladders and ropes and reached the top.  They 
                        had hoped to find divinities but instead found only a meadow filled with flowers.
                        The group stayed on the summit for six days, held Mass in a makeshift hut, and
                        erected three crosses as proof of their accomplishment.  
                        Mont Aiguille wasn’t summitted again until 1834. This is in part because
                        in the 1700s people started to see the allure of scaling mountains for
                        the thrill of the accomplishment, and from this, the sport of mountaineering was born.</p>
                        <h2>Mountaineering Becomes a Sport</h2>
                        <p>De Saussure was so captivated by the sight of the towering Mont Blanc 
                            (15,771 ft/4,807 m), the tallest peak in Europe, that he offered a 
                            monetary reward to the first person who would successfully climb it. 
                            In 1786, his vision finally came true: Mont Blanc was summited by a local doctor
                            , Michel-Gabriel Paccard, and his porter, Jacques Balmat. De Saussure himself
                            reached the top the very next year, and Chamonix local Marie Paradis completed 
                            the first female ascent in 1808.The Mont Blanc ascents were soon followed by the
                            first ascent of the Aiguille du Midi in 1818, and the foundation of the Chamonix
                            guides company in 1823.  Over the next few decades, interest in the Alps continued 
                            to increase among the Swiss, the French and the Germans. However, the real
                            mountaineering frenzy had its source in Victorian England.</p>
                        <h2>Mounteering Spreads to the Rest of the World</h2>
                        <p>The 1960s and 1970s were formative years for mountaineering culture 
                            outside of Europe, with countries such as Canada establishing their own
                            style of mountaineering.  This was also a time of rapid technological
                            advancement, and mountaineers could use artificial aids and more sophisticated
                            techniques. In contrast to heavy-handed “expedition-style trekking,” 
                            many mountaineers turned back to the minimalist “alpine” style of 
                            scaling peaks with hardly any equipment, eschewing the use of oxygen
                            , porters and other forms of help.  By the 1980’s, mountaineering had
                            become very accessible and there was a huge rise in the number of
                            recreational climbers.In general, mountaineering is a group sport in 
                            which members of a team use their combined abilities and resourcefulness
                            to help each other attain their goals.  Following the establishment of
                            the Alpine Club of Great Britain in 1857, other European countries
                            quickly followed the example. Today, there are numerous mountaineering 
                            clubs around the world.  They sponsor expeditions, publish journals, 
                            and offer support to mountaineers in their country.</p>

                            <p>They say records are made to be broken, but best of luck trying to match
                                the superhuman feats of these mountaineers. Our list includes 
                                several sherpas, a couple of world-famous climbers, and a 12-year-old boy.</p>

                                <p>Pemba Dorje Sherpa is a Sherpa from Beding, Rolwaling Valley, Dolkha, 
                                    Nepal. He claims to have made the fastest ever ascent of Mount Everest
                                    on 21 May 2004, taking eight hours and ten minutes. The record was confirmed 
                                    by Nepal's tourism ministry.[1] His record has now been rejected by the Nepal
                                    Supreme Court, the Nepal Ministry of Tourism, and Guinness World Records. His
                                    record was  stripped by the Ministry of Culture, Tourism and Civil Aviation.[2]
                                    Kamal Singh previously set a record for the fastest summit of 12 hours and 45 
                                    minutes in 2003, only to see it broken by Lakpa Gelu Sherpa three days later 
                                    who set a new record of 10 hours 56 minutes.<a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pemba_Dorje target="_blank">

                                    <p>At dusk on 31 July 1954, the Italian mountaineer Lino Lacedelli, who has died aged 83,
                                        was standing on the summit of K2 in the Himalayas, remonstrating
                                        with his climbing partner Achille Compagnoni. The pair had just 
                                        made the first ascent of a peak considered even more difficult and 
                                        dangerous than Everest. But, after an exhausting ordeal, Campagnoni
                                         was close to the limit of his endurance. He preferred, he told
